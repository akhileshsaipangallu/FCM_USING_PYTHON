# FCM_USING_PYTHON
Python client for FCM - Firebase Cloud Messaging (Android & iOS)

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is the new version of GCM. It inherits the reliable and scalable GCM infrastructure, plus new features. GCM users are strongly recommended to upgrade to FCM.

Using FCM, you can notify a client app that new email or other data is available to sync. You can send notifications to drive user reengagement and retention. For use cases such as instant messaging, a message can transfer a payload of up to 4KB to a client app.
